Development setup
=================

I use 'gitflow' Git extensions to provide high-level repository operations for
Vincent Driessen's branching model.

Release HOWTO
=============

To make a release, 

  1) Update release date/version in NEWS.txt, setup.py and src/twerp/__init__.py
  2) Run 'tox' to build and test using multiple Python versions
  3) Upload to PyPI: 'python setup.py sdist register upload'
  4) Increase version in setup.py and src/twerp/__init__.py (for next release)
